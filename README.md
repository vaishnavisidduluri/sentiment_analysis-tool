# Sentiment Analysis Tool

## Overview

This project aims to create a sentiment analysis tool that determines the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text. The tool utilizes sentiment analysis libraries, such as TextBlob, to analyze user-provided sentences or reviews.

## Description

The Sentiment Analysis Tool allows users to input text and receive an analysis of its sentiment. The tool can effectively classify text into three categories:

- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

This project will help you learn about sentiment analysis, working with text data, and utilizing pre-built models for natural language processing

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for the tool.
- TextBlob: A simple library for processing textual data and performing sentiment analysis.
- Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web applications in Python (optional, for UI).
- Other Libraries: You may choose to integrate additional libraries or APIs as needed.
